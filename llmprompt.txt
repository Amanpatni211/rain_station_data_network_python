I have created a GitHub repository for analyzing rain station data networks. Here's my current setup:

Project: rain_station_data_network_python
Structure:
- Using conda environment (rain_station_py)
- Data format: CSV files
- Following organized directory structure:

rain_station_data_network_python/
├── data/              # Data files
│   ├── raw/          # Original data
│   ├── processed/    # Final, cleaned data
│   ├── interim/      # Intermediate data
│   └── external/     # External data
├── notebooks/        # Jupyter notebooks
│   ├── exploratory/  # For exploration
│   └── reports/      # Clean notebooks
├── src/rain_station/ # Source code
│   ├── data/         # Data processing
│   ├── models/       # Analysis code
│   ├── visualization/# Plotting
│   └── utils/        # Helper functions
├── tests/           
├── docs/            
└── configs/          

Environment includes:
- Python packages: pandas, numpy, scipy, networkx, matplotlib, seaborn, jupyter
- Development tools: pytest, black, flake8, pyyaml

Repository is set up with:
- Proper .gitignore
- MIT License
- Comprehensive README.md
- environment.yml for reproducibility

I'm coming from a background of mainly using Jupyter notebooks and want to develop more organized, reproducible workflows. I have a collaborator who will work on a remote server.

What should I work on next to develop this project further?
